# leaflet-challenge
homework for unit 15

I have been tasked with taking data that the USGS has collected about earthquakes and finding a meaniful way to displaying that data.  These visualizations could be useful to help the USGS educate the public & other organizations.

THe data was collected from the USGS GeoJSON feed for all earthquakes in the past 7 days.

Using Leaflet, i was able to create a plot all of the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.  Additionally the markers change size based on the earthquake magnitude and change colors based on the depth.  Pop-ups show information about each earthquake.
